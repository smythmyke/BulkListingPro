# Affiliate & Influencer Outreach Marketing Plan

## Overview

Influencer-driven outreach targeting Etsy sellers, POD creators, digital product sellers, and e-commerce educators. Goal: get BulkListingPro in front of high-volume Etsy sellers through trusted voices in the space.

## Product Summary (For Outreach Context)

**BulkListingPro** is a Chrome extension that automates bulk Etsy listing creation. Users import listings via spreadsheet or UI form, and the extension automates the tedious Etsy listing form.

### Key Features (Current)
- Full listing editor with form view and spreadsheet-style grid view
- CSV/XLSX import and export for bulk workflows
- AI-powered title, description, and tag generation (~8 cents per listing)
- AI listing evaluation — scores each field 1-10 with actionable recommendations
- Tag intelligence — tag library, import tags from Etsy listing URLs, frequency analysis, similar tag warnings
- Validation — duplicate title detection, price outlier warnings, missing field checks
- Autoformat — one-click cleanup of titles, descriptions, tags, and prices
- Image handling — drag/drop, reorder, lightbox preview, dimension/size warnings
- Bulk operations — select all, autoformat all, AI generate for all, batch delete/duplicate
- Undo/redo with 50-action stack

### Pricing
| Pack | Credits | Price | Listings |
|------|---------|-------|----------|
| Starter | 50 | $1.99 | ~25 listings |
| Standard | 150 | $4.99 | ~75 listings |
| Pro | 400 | $11.99 | ~200 listings |
| Power | 1000 | $24.99 | ~500 listings |

- 2 credits per listing
- 10 free credits on signup (no credit card required)
- Failed uploads refunded automatically

### Competitive Positioning
- **vs. Manual Etsy Listing:** Save hours on repetitive form filling
- **vs. Etsy CSV Upload (official):** Etsy's native CSV is limited and buggy for digital products
- **vs. Other Tools (Vela, etc.):** Purpose-built for digital products and POD, not just physical goods

## Part 5: Outreach Strategy by Platform

### YouTube (The "Demo" Play)

**Approach:** The money shot is a screen recording showing 100 listings being created automatically while the creator narrates.

**Pitch Template:**
> "Hey [Name], I built a Chrome extension that bulk-uploads Etsy listings from a spreadsheet. I'd love to send you a free account so you can try uploading 25 listings on camera. Your audience would love a 'How to publish 100 listings in 10 minutes' video. I'll set you up with an affiliate code - 10% commission."

**Best For:** Starla Moore, Dylan Jahraus, Ryan Hogue, Heather X Studio, Nancy Badillo

### Instagram (The "Satisfying Automation" Reel)

**Approach:** Record a 15-30 second screen capture of listings being created automatically. The "automated form filling" is visually satisfying. Tag influencers.

**DM Template:**
> "Hey [Name]! Built a tool that bulk-uploads Etsy listings automatically. Check the Reel I tagged you in - 50 listings in 5 minutes. Want to try it? Free account + affiliate code for your followers."

**Best For:** Aaron Laflin, Lotti, Jennyfromtheshopp, Anji Martin

### TikTok (The "Before/After" Hook)

**Approach:** "POV: You have 200 designs to list on Etsy" → show manual pain → show BulkListingPro automation → reaction.

**Best For:** Jennyfromtheshopp, GovConHacks crossover audience

### Communities (The "Value First" Play)

**Approach:** Join the community. Answer questions about bulk listing for 1-2 weeks. Then mention you built a tool when someone asks about automation. Offer free trial codes to the group.

**Best For:** eRank, Reddit, Alura, Discord groups

## Part 6: What to Offer (Beyond Commission)

### 1. The "Bulk Challenge"
Ask a creator to time themselves listing 50 items manually vs. using BulkListingPro. Offer to pay for the "Battle" video. The visual contrast is the best ad.

### 2. Product Advisory Board
Invite top creators to influence the roadmap (AI metadata, trending tags, POD support). They get a say in features in exchange for promotion. Creates genuine investment.

### 3. Course Bundling
If they have a course (Dylan Jahraus, Starla Moore), offer "3 months free" for their students. Embeds the tool into their curriculum and creates long-term users.

### 4. Custom Features
As the founder/engineer, offer to build a specific feature their audience has been asking for. This is something no affiliate marketer can offer.

### 5. Commission (10%)
Chrome extensions have near-zero marginal cost. Once a seller uses it for 100+ listings, they don't go back. 10% commission on all purchases for 6 months via Stripe Connect.

### 6. Lifetime Subscription
For Tier 1 creators, offer unlimited free usage forever. The endorsement value far exceeds the credit cost.

---

## Part 7: Tiered Approach

### "Beta" Tier (Creators 1-7)
- Offer equity-level partnership or custom features
- Lifetime free usage
- 10% commission via Stripe Connect
- They are "Anchor" partners who move entire communities

### "Review" Tier (Creators 8-30)
- Lifetime subscription + 10% commission
- Ask for a dedicated video or Reel
- Provide XLSX template and demo account pre-loaded with sample listings

### "Community" Tier (Communities 31-40)
- Provide value first (answer questions, share tips)
- Give away "Free Trial" codes (25 free credits) to build buzz
- Sponsor a "Tool Spotlight" post with community admins
- No hard sell - let the product speak

---

## Part 8: Swipe Files (Ready-to-Use Copy for Influencers)

Send these in a Google Doc alongside screenshots and a B-roll screen recording clip.

### YouTube Description Block (above the fold)

> I've been using BulkListingPro to prep all my Etsy listings before I publish. It writes my titles, descriptions, and tags with AI, then scores everything so I know what needs work — all from one editor inside Chrome.
> Try it here: [AFFILIATE_LINK]

### 30-Second Video Script — Option A: "The Volume Play"

> "So I listed over a hundred products last week and I want to show you how. I've been using this Chrome extension called BulkListingPro. You load in a spreadsheet of your products, and it gives you this full editor where you can see everything in a grid. Then you hit one button and it generates all your titles, descriptions, and tags with AI. It even scores each listing and tells you what to fix. The AI costs about 8 cents per listing which is kind of absurd. Link is in my description if you want to try it."

### 30-Second Video Script — Option B: "The Before/After"

> "Let me show you something real quick. This is what my listing looked like before — generic title, three tags, no real description. I ran it through BulkListingPro, which is this Chrome extension with a built-in AI editor. It rewrote my title for Etsy search, gave me all 13 tags, wrote a full description, and then scored everything on a scale of 1 to 10. Took about 15 seconds. I'll put the link below if you want to try it on your own listings."

### Pinned Comment Template

> A bunch of you are asking about the listing tool from this video — it's called BulkListingPro. Chrome extension, works right in your browser. The AI generation is what saves me the most time — titles, descriptions, and all 13 tags in seconds. Here's the link: [AFFILIATE_LINK]

## Part 8b: Message Templates

### Outreach Email (For YouTube Educators)

**Subject:** Quick collab? Free tool for your Etsy audience

> Hi [Name],
>
> I've been watching your Etsy content and think your audience would genuinely get value from a tool I built called BulkListingPro.
>
> It's a Chrome extension with a full listing editor — you import a spreadsheet of products, and it gives you a grid view of all your listings. From there you can generate titles, descriptions, and all 13 tags with AI for about 8 cents per listing. It also scores each listing and tells you exactly what to fix before you publish.
>
> The visual workflow demos really well on video — importing 50 listings from a spreadsheet, hitting "Autoformat All," watching the validation scores turn green. Takes about 30 seconds to show.
>
> I'd love to set you up with an affiliate link (you earn a commission on every credit pack sold) plus a free account so you can try it yourself. I've also put together a quick media kit with screenshots, a B-roll screen recording, and ready-to-use copy for your description and comments if you want it.
>
> No pressure either way — happy to answer any questions.
>
> [Your name]
> Founder, BulkListingPro

### Instagram DM (For Workflow Influencers)

> Hey [Name]! I built a Chrome extension for Etsy sellers — it has a full listing editor with AI that writes titles, descriptions, and tags for 8 cents each, then scores your listings so you know what to fix. Your followers would love it. Want to try it free? I'll set you up with an affiliate link too.

### Community Post (For Facebook Groups / Discord)

> Been working on a tool to solve the "listing grind" problem. If you sell digital products or POD on Etsy, I built a Chrome extension with a listing editor that imports from a spreadsheet and has AI that generates your titles, descriptions, and all 13 tags. It also scores each listing 1-10 and tells you exactly what to improve. Happy to give free trial codes to anyone who wants to test it. Not trying to spam — genuinely built this because I had the same problem.

### Reddit Reply (For Pain Point Threads)

> I actually built a tool for this. It's a Chrome extension with a listing editor — you import from XLSX/CSV, edit everything in a grid or form view, and it has AI that generates titles, descriptions, and tags for about 8 cents per listing. Also scores each listing and flags what needs work. Free to try (10 credits on signup, no card needed). [link]

---

## Part 11: Key Messaging by Audience

### For POD Sellers (Ryan Hogue, Heather X, Cassiy Johnson)
> "You have 200 designs. Each one needs a title, description, 13 tags, price, images. BulkListingPro imports them from a spreadsheet, generates the SEO copy with AI, and scores each listing before you publish."

### For Digital Product Sellers (Nancy Badillo, Aaron Laflin)
> "Planners, SVGs, templates — you list 50 variations of the same product. Import them all from one spreadsheet, hit 'AI Generate All,' and every listing gets unique titles, descriptions, and tags in seconds."

### For SEO/Strategy Educators (Starla Moore, Kate Hayes)
> "Your students spend hours writing listing copy. BulkListingPro's AI generates Etsy-optimized titles and all 13 tags, then scores each listing 1-10 and tells them exactly what to fix. It's like having a listing audit tool built into the editor."

### For Beginners (Lotti, Simply Shawna, Lizzie Smiley)
> "Starting an Etsy shop feels overwhelming. BulkListingPro has an editor that walks you through every field, generates your titles and tags with AI, and tells you if anything is missing before you publish. 10 free credits to try, no credit card."

### For High-Volume/Scaling (Dylan Jahraus, Lauren Kilgore)
> "You can't scale to 1,000 listings by hand-writing each one. BulkListingPro's spreadsheet import + AI generation is the bridge between 50 products and 500 products without hiring a VA."

---

## Part 12: Things to Avoid

- **Never say "automates Etsy's UI" or "human-like automation" in public content** — this directly flags TOS concerns and creates a permanent searchable record. Market the editor and AI features, which are pre-upload tools
- **Never say "extracts competitor tags"** — reframe as "helps you research what tags top sellers are using"
- **Never promise discount codes** unless the promo code system is actually built and working
- **Never claim "rank higher on Etsy"** — unprovable and sets up disappointed users. Frame as "optimize your listings for Etsy search"
- Don't spam Reddit or Facebook groups — provide value first, mention tool second
- Don't send the same generic email to every creator — customize per niche
- Don't lead with price or commission — lead with "your audience has this problem, I built the solution"
- Don't cold DM without engaging their content first (comment on 2-3 posts minimum)
- Be transparent about the Native Host requirement (it's a one-time setup, but it's a friction point)
